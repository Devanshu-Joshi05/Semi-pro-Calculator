# Semi-pro-Calculator
I made this calculator in react native as a challenge to see what i have learned so far.
Its nothing to crazy, but it did turn out pretty good (not great but decent).
If you have anything to add to this project feel free to do so, and if there is any suggestion for any code improvement then i am all ears.

thx :)
